Lamba Expressiion :

In programming, a Lambda expression (or function) is just an anonymous function, i.e., a function with no name and without being bounded to an identifier.

Basic Syntax :

		(paramater) -> expression
		OR
		(paramater) -> { statements }
		OR 
		() -> expression

Example :
(x,y) -> x+y //This function takes two parameters and return their sum.
